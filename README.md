# DayTrade_System

Repository for sharing result of my final assignment experiments.

It consists in validate the use of Random Forest for predicting the Maximum and Minimum value that a Stock can reach in BOVESPA. Then, based on these predictions, suggest the a moment to execute the Buy/Sell operation.

It's based on the approach studyied and suggested by Martinez (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221533996_From_an_artificial_neural_network_to_a_stock_market_day-trading_system_A_case_study_on_the_BMF_BOVESPA).

### Experiments

The experiments were made over the two historically most negotiated stocks in Bobvespa: Petrobras(PETR4) and Vale (VALE3). They are structured in the following way:

1st Part: Predictions
  1. Benchmarks;
  2. Martinez Experiment Reproduction;
  3. Improving the proposed MLP;
  4. Evaluating Random Forest for this problem;
  5. Running Random Forest for any stock.

2nd Part: Suggestions
